# Claude-PRINCE2

**PRINCE2 Methodology API for AI-Optimized Project Management**

Claude-PRINCE2 provides a structured, AI-optimized implementation of PRINCE2 project management methodology, designed for seamless human-AI collaboration in project delivery across research, development, and operational contexts.

**Current Status:** This project is a fresh clone of claude-swift, currently being restructured to implement PRINCE2 methodology API. The existing documentation (excluding `/docs/preliminary/`) reflects the claude-swift foundation and will be adapted as the PRINCE2 transformation progresses.

## Purpose

Transform PRINCE2's proven project management framework into an executable workflow API that:
- Maintains PRINCE2's structured governance without bureaucratic overhead
- Optimizes all processes for AI execution with human strategic control
- Provides foundation for multi-methodology project environments
- Delivers pragmatic project management for any project type

## Core PRINCE2 Workflows

### Project Lifecycle
- `initiate sesame` ‚Üí **Project Initiation** (Starting up + Initiating processes)
- `stage sesame` ‚Üí **Stage Management** (Stage boundary + Controlling processes)
- `deliver sesame` ‚Üí **Product Delivery** (Managing product delivery)
- `close sesame` ‚Üí **Project Closure** (Closing project process)

### Theme Management
- `business sesame` ‚Üí **Business Case Management** (Justification and value)
- `risk sesame` ‚Üí **Risk Management** (Uncertainty and opportunity)
- `quality sesame` ‚Üí **Quality Management** (Fitness for purpose)
- `change sesame` ‚Üí **Change Management** (Issue and change control)

### Governance
- `direct sesame` ‚Üí **Project Direction** (Project Board governance)
- `report sesame` ‚Üí **Progress Reporting** (Monitoring and control)
- `exception sesame` ‚Üí **Exception Management** (Escalation and recovery)

## Operational Workflows

### Session Management
- `start sesame` ‚Üí **Session Start** (Project stage preparation)
- `finish sesame` ‚Üí **Session End** (Handover and continuity)

### Technical Integration
- `git sesame` ‚Üí **Version Control** (Change management integration)
- `github sesame` ‚Üí **Repository Management** (Issue and product tracking)

### Planning and Analysis
- `planning sesame` ‚Üí **Work Planning** (Planned vs unplanned work)
- `next sesame` ‚Üí **Priority Management** (Work package sequencing)
- `todo sesame` ‚Üí **Task Continuity** (Cross-session work management)

## Quick Start

1. **Deploy the system:** `deploy sesame`
2. **Initialize project:** `initiate sesame`
3. **Start first stage:** `stage sesame`
4. **Begin work delivery:** `deliver sesame`

## Project History and Evolution

### Development Journey
Claude-PRINCE2 represents Phase 3 in the evolution of AI-optimized project management:

1. **Phase 1:** Embedded coding workflows with lifecycle management
2. **Phase 2:** Claude-Swift deployable operational system with project hooks  
3. **Phase 3:** Claude-PRINCE2 methodology API for structured project management *(current development)*
4. **Future:** Multi-methodology orchestration (PRINCE2 + ITIL + others)

### Current Transformation Status
- **Foundation:** Fresh clone of claude-swift (December 2024)
- **Active Development:** PRINCE2 methodology API design and implementation
- **Documentation State:** Most documentation reflects claude-swift origins and requires adaptation
- **New PRINCE2 Content:** Located in `/docs/preliminary/` folder
- **Infrastructure:** Retaining proven claude-swift router-subworkflow architecture

### Restructuring Progress
- ‚úÖ **Analysis Complete:** PRINCE2 schematic and workflow mapping
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Designed:** Methodology API approach established  
- üîÑ **In Progress:** PRINCE2 workflow implementation
- ‚è≥ **Planned:** Documentation adaptation from claude-swift to PRINCE2 context

## Architecture Principles

- **AI-Optimized Execution** - All workflows designed for reliable AI execution
- **Human Strategic Control** - Strategic decisions remain with humans
- **Methodology Fidelity** - True to PRINCE2 principles and processes
- **Pragmatic Implementation** - Structured without bureaucratic overhead
- **Template Portability** - Deployable to any project context
- **Scalable Foundation** - Ready for multi-methodology expansion

## Technical Foundation

Built on proven claude-swift architecture:
- **Router-Subworkflow Pattern** - Intelligent workflow navigation
- **Comprehensive Audit System** - Complete project activity tracking  
- **Session Continuity** - Cross-session work management
- **Template System** - Clean deployment and upgrade patterns
- **AI-Human Collaboration** - Optimized partnership workflows

## Contributing

This project follows the collaborative development patterns established in claude-swift, optimized for human-AI partnership where humans provide strategic direction and AI handles tactical execution.
